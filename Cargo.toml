# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by

# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so isn't great for
# code size when deploying.

# See wasm-opt for full available options; handy examples:
# -O4 - optimize aggressively for performance
# -Oz - optimize aggressively for code size
# -g - leave debug info in place, allowing for more descriptive stack traces on panic
# --signext-lowering - removes opcodes that the screeps servers can't load (see 
# https://github.com/rustyscreeps/screeps-game-api/issues/391)
